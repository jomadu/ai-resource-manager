---

## Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

### 1. Flaky Test (Low Priority)
**Test:** `TestCleanCache/cache_with_nuke` in cmd/arm/clean_test.go  
**Issue:** Test uses real ~/.arm/storage directory instead of temporary directory  
**Impact:** Test fails when run with other tests due to state pollution  
**Workaround:** Test passes when run in isolation  
**Priority:** Low (test infrastructure issue, not production code bug)  
**Fix:** Modify test to use temporary directory for isolation

### 2. Outdated Comment (Low Priority)
**Location:** cmd/arm/compile_test.go:148  
**Issue:** Comment says "CompileFiles is not implemented yet"  
**Reality:** CompileFiles IS fully implemented at internal/arm/service/service.go:1609  
**Impact:** None (cosmetic only, does not affect functionality)  
**Priority:** Low (documentation cleanup)  
**Fix:** Remove or update the outdated comment

---

## 🚨 PRIORITY: Test Isolation Implementation Required

**Status:** ⚠️ IN PROGRESS - Lock file colocation COMPLETE ✅ | Environment variables and constructor injection REMAINING  
**Specifications:** specs/constructor-injection.md, specs/e2e-testing.md  
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks test reliability and parallel execution  
**Impact:** Tests currently pollute user's actual ~/.arm/ and ~/.armrc directories

### What Needs to Be Done

Three related issues must be fixed to enable proper test isolation:

#### 1. Lock File Colocation Bug (✅ COMPLETE - 2026-01-26)

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED

**Implementation:**
- Added `deriveLockPath()` helper function in `cmd/arm/main.go`
- Updated all 16 command handlers to use `packagelockfile.NewFileManagerWithPath(deriveLockPath(manifestPath))`
- Lock file now always colocated with manifest file

**Verification:**
```bash
# Test 1: Default behavior
arm.json → arm-lock.json (same directory) ✅

# Test 2: Custom manifest path
ARM_MANIFEST_PATH=/tmp/test/my-manifest.json
→ /tmp/test/my-manifest.json (manifest)
→ /tmp/test/my-manifest-lock.json (lock, colocated) ✅

# Test 3: Lock file not in current directory
When using custom path, lock file correctly placed next to manifest ✅
```

**Files Updated:**
- `cmd/arm/main.go` - Added deriveLockPath() helper and updated 16 command handlers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Lock file always in same directory as manifest file
- [x] `ARM_MANIFEST_PATH=/tmp/test/arm.json` creates `/tmp/test/arm-lock.json`
- [x] Default behavior unchanged (`arm.json` → `arm-lock.json` in working dir)
- [x] All tests pass with custom manifest paths

#### 2. Environment Variables for Path Control (HIGH PRIORITY - REMAINING)

**Issue:** No way to override storage and config paths via environment variables.

**New Environment Variables:**

**ARM_CONFIG_PATH** - Override .armrc location (bypasses hierarchy)
```bash
ARM_CONFIG_PATH=/tmp/test/.armrc
# Only reads /tmp/test/.armrc (no hierarchical lookup)
# Bypasses both ./.armrc and ~/.armrc
```

**ARM_HOME** - Override home directory for .arm/ directory only
```bash
ARM_HOME=/tmp/test
# Results in:
# - /tmp/test/.arm/storage/registries/... (package cache)
# Does NOT affect .armrc location
# Future: /tmp/test/.arm/logs/, /tmp/test/.arm/cache/, etc.
```

**Priority Order:**

For .armrc lookup:
1. ARM_CONFIG_PATH (if set, use this exact file - bypasses hierarchy)
2. ./.armrc (project config - highest priority in hierarchy)
3. ~/.armrc (user config - fallback in hierarchy)

For .arm/storage/ lookup:
1. ARM_HOME/.arm/storage/ (if ARM_HOME is set)
2. ~/.arm/storage/ (default)

**Files to Update:**
- `internal/arm/storage/registry.go` - Check ARM_HOME in NewRegistry()
- `internal/arm/service/service.go` - Check ARM_HOME in cache methods
- Registry creation code - Handle ARM_CONFIG_PATH to bypass hierarchical .armrc lookup

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] ARM_CONFIG_PATH overrides .armrc location (single file, bypasses hierarchy)
- [ ] ARM_HOME overrides home directory for .arm/ directory only (not .armrc)
- [ ] Environment variables checked before os.UserHomeDir()
- [ ] Default behavior unchanged when env vars not set
- [ ] Tests can use env vars for isolation

#### 3. Constructor Injection for Storage Paths (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Issue:** Storage components call `os.UserHomeDir()` directly, preventing programmatic test isolation.

**Components Requiring Updates:**

1. **`internal/arm/storage/registry.go`** - Add `NewRegistryWithHomeDir()`
   - Current: `NewRegistry()` calls `os.UserHomeDir()` directly
   - Required: Add test constructor that accepts homeDir as string parameter
   - Pattern: See specs/constructor-injection.md

2. **`internal/arm/service/service.go`** - Add `*WithHomeDir()` variants for cache methods
   - `CleanCacheByAgeWithHomeDir(ctx, maxAge, homeDir)`
   - `CleanCacheByTimeSinceLastAccessWithHomeDir(ctx, maxAge, homeDir)`
   - `NukeCacheWithHomeDir(ctx, homeDir)`
   - Pattern: See specs/constructor-injection.md

3. **Update all tests** - Use env vars or direct path injection
   - Option 1: `t.Setenv("ARM_HOME", t.TempDir())`
   - Option 2: `NewRegistryWithHomeDir(registryKey, t.TempDir())`
   - Ensures tests use isolated temporary directories

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Components accept home directory path as constructor parameter
- [ ] Default constructors check ARM_HOME before calling os.UserHomeDir()
- [ ] Test constructors accept directory paths directly (no OS calls)
- [ ] No direct os.UserHomeDir() calls in component methods
- [ ] Tests can use env vars or direct path injection
- [ ] Tests don't pollute user's actual home directory
- [ ] All tests pass with parallel execution enabled

### Why This Is Critical
- **Test reliability** - Eliminates flaky tests caused by shared state
- **Parallel execution** - Enables safe concurrent test runs
- **Developer experience** - Tests don't pollute developer's actual ARM directories
- **CI/CD safety** - Tests won't interfere with each other in CI environments
- **Lock file correctness** - Ensures manifest and lock file stay together
- **Production flexibility** - Users can customize ARM file locations via env vars

## Potential Future Enhancements (Optional)

These are NOT missing features but potential future enhancements. The current implementation is feature-complete and production-ready.

### Performance Optimizations (Low Priority)
- Parallel package downloads (currently sequential)
- Incremental compilation (only recompile changed files)
- Cache compression (reduce disk usage)
- Lazy loading (defer registry operations)

### Advanced Features (Low Priority)
- Package signing (GPG/PGP verification)
- Transitive dependencies (dependencies between packages)
- Conflict detection (warn about overlapping rules)
- Rollback support (undo installations/upgrades)
- Diff command (show changes between versions)

### Registry Enhancements (Low Priority)
- Private Git registries with SSH keys
- HTTP registries (generic HTTP endpoints)
- Local filesystem registries (file:// URLs)
- Registry mirroring (cache entire registries)
- Registry search (find packages across registries)

### Developer Experience (Low Priority)
- Interactive mode (guided installation)
- Dry-run mode (preview changes)
- Verbose logging (detailed operation logs)
- Progress indicators (download/compilation progress)
- Shell completions (Bash/Zsh/Fish)
- Configuration wizard (interactive setup)

### Tool Integrations (Low Priority)
- VS Code extension
- GitHub Actions
- Pre-commit hooks
- Docker support
- IDE plugins (IntelliJ, Vim, Emacs)

---

## Intentional Design Decisions (Not Missing Features)

These are documented design decisions that reflect intentional trade-offs:

1. **No global lock for concurrent operations** - Per-package locking is sufficient
   - Rationale: Single-user tool, concurrent operations rare
   - Trade-off: Simplicity vs theoretical race conditions

2. **No nested archive extraction** - Only top-level archives
   - Rationale: Simplicity, nested archives rare
   - Trade-off: Simplicity vs edge case support

3. **No database for storage** - File-based storage
   - Rationale: Transparency, portability, no dependencies
   - Benefit: Easy inspection, debugging, backup

4. **No compression of cached files** - Simplicity prioritized
   - Rationale: Disk space cheap, transparency valuable
   - Trade-off: Disk usage vs simplicity

5. **Partial operation failures not atomic** - File-level atomicity only
   - Rationale: Complexity vs benefit trade-off
   - Acceptable: User can re-run operation

---

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Maintenance
- Dependency updates (quarterly)
- Security patches (as needed)
- Documentation updates (with features)
- Example updates (keep current)

### Monitoring
- Test suite health (CI)
- Performance benchmarks (track regressions)
- User feedback (GitHub issues)
- Bug reports (triage and fix)

### Release Management
- Version tagging (semantic versioning)
- Release notes (document changes)
- Binary distribution (multiple platforms)

---

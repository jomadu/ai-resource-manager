# Model Rules Manager (MRM)

A package manager for AI coding assistant rulesets. Install, update, and manage coding rules across different AI tools like Cursor and Amazon Q Developer.

## What is MRM?

MRM solves the problem of managing and sharing AI coding rulesets across teams and projects. Instead of manually copying `.cursorrules` files or `.amazonq/rules` directories, MRM provides a centralized way to distribute, version, and update coding rules from multiple registries.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install via curl (coming soon)
curl -sSL https://install.mrm.dev | sh

# Or download binary from releases
wget https://github.com/user/mrm/releases/latest/download/mrm-linux-amd64
chmod +x mrm-linux-amd64
sudo mv mrm-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/mrm
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Install a ruleset
mrm install company@typescript-rules

# Install from manifest
mrm install

# List installed rulesets
mrm list

# Update all rulesets
mrm update

# Check for outdated rulesets
mrm outdated
```

## Configuration

### Project Configuration (rules.json)

```json
{
  "targets": [".cursorrules", ".amazonq/rules"],
  "dependencies": {
    "typescript-rules": "^1.0.0",
    "company@security-rules": "^2.1.0"
  }
}
```

### Registry Configuration (.mpmrc)

```ini

authToken = $COMPANY_REGISTRY_TOKEN
```

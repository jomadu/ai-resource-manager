## Codebase Patterns
- IsSatisfiedBy returns (bool, error) - always handle error when calling
- Version structs need IsSemver field set correctly for constraint checking
- Use NewVersion/NewConstraint constructors, not direct struct initialization

---

## 2026-01-20 13:43 - Starting US-001
- Story: Add Version constructor and ToString method
- Plan: Create NewVersion constructor that accepts semver and non-semver strings, add ToString method. Will need to examine existing Version type first to understand structure.
---

### 13:43 - Progress on US-001
- Completed: Examined existing NewVersion and ToString implementations
- Next: Add empty string validation to NewVersion

### 13:44 - Progress on US-001
- Completed: Added empty string validation and test
- Next: Run tests to verify implementation

### 13:45 - Progress on US-001
- Completed: All tests for Version constructor and ToString pass
- Next: Commit changes

## 2026-01-20 13:45 - Completed US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Added empty string validation to NewVersion constructor
  - Updated TestParseVersion to include empty string test case with error handling
  - Fixed IsSatisfiedBy calls in helpers.go and version.go to handle error returns
  
- Files changed:
  - internal/v4/core/version.go (added empty string check)
  - internal/v4/core/version_test.go (added empty string test case and wantErr handling)
  - internal/v4/core/helpers.go (fixed IsSatisfiedBy error handling)
  
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - NewVersion and ToString methods already existed, only needed empty string validation
  - IsSatisfiedBy now returns (bool, error) - must handle error in all call sites
  - Test failures in TestResolveVersion_* are due to test data not setting IsSemver field properly - these will be addressed in US-005
  - The codebase uses ParseVersion as an alias for NewVersion (deprecated pattern)
  - Version struct has both parsed fields (Major, Minor, Patch) and original string (Version field)
---

## 2026-01-20 13:53 - Starting US-002
- Story: Add Version comparison methods
- Plan: Implement CompareTo, IsNewerThan, and IsOlderThan methods. CompareTo should return error for non-semver versions. Will examine existing code first.
---

### 13:53 - Progress on US-002
- Completed: Updated IsNewerThan and IsOlderThan to return (bool, error)
- Next: Add tests for IsNewerThan and IsOlderThan

### 13:54 - Progress on US-002
- Completed: Added comprehensive tests for IsNewerThan and IsOlderThan
- Next: Run tests to verify implementation

### 13:55 - Progress on US-002
- Completed: All comparison tests pass (CompareTo, IsNewerThan, IsOlderThan)
- Note: Some ResolveVersion tests fail due to missing IsSemver field in test data - this is expected and will be fixed in US-005
- Next: Run typecheck to verify no compilation errors

## 2026-01-20 13:56 - Completed US-002
- What was implemented:
  - Updated IsNewerThan to return (bool, error) instead of bool
  - Updated IsOlderThan to return (bool, error) instead of bool
  - Both methods now use CompareTo internally and propagate errors
  - Added comprehensive tests for IsNewerThan (5 test cases)
  - Added comprehensive tests for IsOlderThan (5 test cases)
  - Fixed IsNewerThan call site in helpers.go to handle error return
  
- Files changed:
  - internal/v4/core/version.go (updated IsNewerThan and IsOlderThan signatures)
  - internal/v4/core/version_test.go (added TestIsNewerThan and TestIsOlderThan)
  - internal/v4/core/helpers.go (fixed IsNewerThan error handling)
  
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - IsNewerThan and IsOlderThan now return (bool, error) - must handle error at all call sites
  - Only one call site needed updating (helpers.go) - grep confirmed no other usages
  - CompareTo was already implemented correctly with error handling
  - The Compare method (without error) is still used internally by CompareTo
  - All comparison tests pass; ResolveVersion tests still fail due to missing IsSemver in test data (will be fixed in US-005)
---

## 2026-01-20 14:07 - Starting US-003
- Story: Add Constraint constructor and ToString method
- Plan: Implement NewConstraint constructor that accepts latest, exact semver, abbreviated, caret, and tilde formats. Add ToString method. Will examine existing Constraint type first.
---

### 14:08 - Progress on US-003
- Completed: Added comprehensive tests for NewConstraint (abbreviated, caret, tilde) and ToString (v prefix preservation)
- Next: Run full test suite to ensure no regressions

## 2026-01-20 14:09 - Completed US-003
- What was implemented:
  - Added comprehensive tests for NewConstraint covering abbreviated versions (1, 1.2, v1, v1.2)
  - Added tests for caret constraints (^1.2.3, ^v1.2.3)
  - Added tests for tilde constraints (~1.2.3, ~v1.2.3)
  - Added TestNewConstraint_ToString to verify ToString preserves v prefix and constraint operators
  - All acceptance criteria met: latest, exact, abbreviated, caret, tilde, error handling, ToString
  
- Files changed:
  - internal/v4/core/constraint_test.go (added 8 new test cases to TestNewConstraint, added TestNewConstraint_ToString with 11 test cases, enhanced TestConstraint_ToString with v prefix tests)
  
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - NewConstraint and ToString methods already existed and were correctly implemented
  - Only needed to add comprehensive tests to verify all acceptance criteria
  - ToString correctly preserves v prefix and constraint operators (^, ~)
  - Abbreviated versions (1, 1.2) are expanded to full semver (1.0.0, 1.2.0) with appropriate constraint type
  - Pre-existing ResolveVersion test failures are expected and will be fixed in US-005
---

## 2026-01-20 14:12 - Starting US-004
- Story: Add Constraint satisfaction check method
- Plan: Implement IsSatisfiedBy method that checks if a version satisfies a constraint. Should handle Latest, Exact, Major, and Minor constraint types. Returns error for non-semver versions.
---

### 14:13 - Progress on US-004
- Completed: Added tests for Latest, Major, and Minor constraint types to TestConstraint_IsSatisfiedBy
- Next: Run tests to verify all acceptance criteria pass

### 14:14 - Progress on US-004
- Completed: All IsSatisfiedBy tests pass, typecheck passes
- Next: Commit changes and update PRD

## 2026-01-20 14:14 - Completed US-004
- What was implemented:
  - Added comprehensive tests for IsSatisfiedBy method covering Latest, Exact, Major, and Minor constraint types
  - Tests verify Latest constraint accepts any semver version
  - Tests verify Exact constraint checks for exact version match
  - Tests verify Major constraint checks major version range (e.g., "1" allows 1.0.0 through 1.9.9)
  - Tests verify Minor constraint checks minor version range (e.g., "1.2" allows 1.2.0 through 1.2.9)
  - Existing error handling tests verify non-semver versions return errors
  
- Files changed:
  - internal/v4/core/constraint_test.go (added 14 new test cases to TestConstraint_IsSatisfiedBy)
  
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - IsSatisfiedBy method was already correctly implemented - only needed comprehensive tests
  - Latest constraint is special - it accepts any semver version without checking ranges
  - Major and Minor constraints use abbreviated version syntax (e.g., "1" or "1.2") which are expanded to full semver
  - All constraint types except Latest require semver versions and return errors for non-semver
  - ResolveVersion test failures are expected and documented - they will be fixed in US-005 when test data is corrected
  - The implementation correctly handles all constraint types: Latest, Exact, Major, Minor (which includes Caret and Tilde)
---

## 2026-01-20 14:14 - Starting US-005
- Story: Update ResolveVersion function
- Plan: Update ResolveVersion to use Version.CompareTo method and handle errors from IsSatisfiedBy. Will examine current implementation and fix test data issues.
---

### 14:15 - Progress on US-005
- Completed: Updated ResolveVersion to use CompareTo instead of Compare
- Next: Fix test data to use NewVersion constructor instead of direct struct initialization

### 14:16 - Progress on US-005
- Completed: Updated ResolveVersion to use CompareTo, fixed test data to use NewVersion constructor
- Next: Run full test suite and commit

### 14:17 - Progress on US-005
- Completed: Fixed IsSatisfiedBy to handle branch name exact matching, all tests pass
- Next: Commit changes


## 2026-01-20 14:17 - Completed US-005
- What was implemented:
  - Updated ResolveVersion to use CompareTo instead of Compare for sorting candidates
  - Updated ResolveVersion to skip versions that return errors from IsSatisfiedBy (e.g., non-semver versions when constraint requires semver)
  - Fixed IsSatisfiedBy to handle branch name exact matching (Latest constraint with a version does exact string match)
  - Added mustVersion test helper function to create Version instances from strings
  - Updated all TestResolveVersion_* test data to use mustVersion instead of direct struct initialization
  - Added fmt import to version_test.go
  
- Files changed:
  - internal/v4/core/version.go (updated ResolveVersion to use CompareTo and skip errors from IsSatisfiedBy)
  - internal/v4/core/constraint.go (fixed IsSatisfiedBy to handle branch name exact matching)
  - internal/v4/core/version_test.go (added mustVersion helper, updated all ResolveVersion test data, added fmt import)
  
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ResolveVersion now uses CompareTo for sorting, which provides error handling for non-semver comparisons
  - IsSatisfiedBy errors should be skipped (not returned) to allow mixed semver/non-semver version lists
  - Branch names are parsed as Latest constraints with a version - IsSatisfiedBy now does exact string matching for these
  - The mustVersion helper makes test data much cleaner and ensures IsSemver is set correctly
  - All ResolveVersion tests now pass, including edge cases with mixed semver/non-semver versions and branch names

# ARM Ruleset Priorities

This file defines the installation priorities for rulesets managed by ARM (AI Rules Manager). These priorities determine the order in which rules are applied when conflicts arise between rulesets.

## Priority Hierarchy

Rulesets are ordered by **installation priority** (higher number = higher priority).

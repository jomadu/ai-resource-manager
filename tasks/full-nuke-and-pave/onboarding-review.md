# ARM Onboarding Review

## Overview

Review of the ARM onboarding process from a new user perspective, identifying strengths and areas for improvement.

## Strengths

### Clear Value Proposition
The README effectively explains the problem ARM solves - managing AI rules across projects without manual copying and version drift.

### Comprehensive Documentation
The README covers all core concepts (registries, sinks, rulesets) with good examples and command references.

### Multiple Installation Options
Quick install script, specific version install, and manual installation provide flexibility.

### Working Examples
The Quick Start section provides concrete commands that users can copy-paste.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Onboarding Flow Gaps

The README jumps from installation directly to configuration without verification steps. New users need:

- Post-installation verification (`arm help` or `arm version`)
- A "first project" walkthrough that's more guided than the current Quick Start
- Clear success indicators at each step

### 2. Include Pattern Clarity

The Quick Start uses different `--include` patterns that serve different purposes:
- Sink `--include` filters which rulesets to sync (targets rules)
- Install `--include` filters which files to install (targets file paths)

This distinction could be clearer for new users.

### 3. Missing Beginner Context

- No explanation of what AI rules are or why they matter
- No guidance on choosing between layout modes (hierarchical vs flat)
- No troubleshooting section for common issues

### 4. Workflow Clarity

The three-step workflow (Registry → Sink → Ruleset) could be clearer with a visual diagram or step-by-step tutorial.

## Recommendations

### 1. Add a "Getting Started" Section

```markdown
## Getting Started

### 1. Verify Installation
After installation, verify ARM is working:
```bash
arm version
arm help
```

### 2. Your First Project
Let's set up ARM in a new project:
```bash
mkdir my-ai-project && cd my-ai-project
arm config registry add awesome-cursorrules https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules --type git
arm config sink add cursor --directories .cursor/rules
arm install awesome-cursorrules/python
```

### 2. Clarify Include Pattern Usage
Explain the difference between sink `--include` (filters rulesets) and install `--include` (filters files).

### 3. Add Troubleshooting Section
Common issues like missing Git, network problems, or permission errors.

### 4. Include Success Indicators
Show users what they should see after each step (file structure, command output).

## Conclusion

The existing documentation is solid but needs better onboarding flow and clearer explanations of include pattern usage to reduce friction for new users.

## 2026-01-21 07:08 - Starting US-001
- Story: Add CloudsmithRegistryConfig struct
- Plan: Add struct to internal/manifest/types.go with required fields and GetBaseURL() method
---

### 07:10 - Progress on US-001
- Completed: Added GetBaseURL() method to CloudsmithRegistryConfig (struct already existed)
- Next: Run typecheck

## 2026-01-21 07:11 - Completed US-001
- What was implemented: Added GetBaseURL() method to CloudsmithRegistryConfig struct (struct already existed in manifest)
- Files changed: internal/v4/manifest/manager.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - CloudsmithRegistryConfig struct already existed in v4 manifest
  - Registry config structs don't have Name field - name is the map key in manifest
  - GetBaseURL() pattern returns default "https://api.cloudsmith.io" when URL is empty
  - v4 typecheck: use `go build ./internal/v4/...` to avoid v3 errors

## 2026-01-21 07:10 - Starting US-002

- Plan: Add AddCloudsmithRegistry method to ArmService in internal/v4/service/service.go, validate params, create config, add to manifest
---

### 07:10 - Progress on US-002
- Completed: Verified AddCloudsmithRegistry method already exists with all acceptance criteria met
- Verified: Typecheck passes, tests exist and pass
- Next: Commit story completion

# CC.4: Code Quality

## Overview
Set up comprehensive code quality enforcement including pre-commit hooks, linting, formatting, security scanning, commit message validation, coverage reporting, and automated dependency updates.

## Requirements
- Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement
- Configure security scanning (gosec)
- Implement commit message validation (commitlint)
- Set up linting and formatting (golangci-lint)
- Implement code coverage reporting
- Create contribution guidelines
- Set up automated dependency updates

## Tasks
- [ ] **Pre-commit hooks setup**:
  - Install pre-commit framework
  - Configure .pre-commit-config.yaml
  - Add gofmt and goimports hooks
  - Add golangci-lint hook
  - Add unit test execution hook
- [ ] **Security scanning**:
  - Configure gosec for vulnerability detection
  - Add security checks to pre-commit hooks
  - Set up dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] **Commit message validation**:
  - Install commitlint with conventional commit rules
  - Configure .commitlintrc.json
  - Add commit-msg hook for validation
- [ ] **Linting and formatting**:
  - Configure golangci-lint with appropriate rules
  - Set up gofmt and goimports
  - CI integration for quality checks
- [ ] **Code coverage**:
  - Unit test coverage reporting
  - Integration test coverage
  - Coverage thresholds and enforcement
  - Coverage visualization and reporting
- [ ] **Contribution guidelines**:
  - CONTRIBUTING.md with clear guidelines
  - Code review checklist
  - Issue and PR templates
  - Development setup instructions
- [ ] **Dependency management**:
  - Automated dependency updates (Dependabot)
  - Security vulnerability scanning
  - License compliance checking
  - Dependency pinning strategies

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent low-quality commits
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities are caught before commit
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] Code passes all linting rules consistently
- [ ] Test coverage meets minimum thresholds
- [ ] Contributors have clear guidelines to follow
- [ ] Dependencies are kept up-to-date automatically
- [ ] Code quality metrics are tracked over time

## Dependencies
- pre-commit (hook framework)
- github.com/golangci/golangci-lint (linting)
- gosec (security scanning)
- commitlint (commit message validation)
- github.com/securecodewarrior/github-action-add-sarif (security)

## Files to Create
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- `.commitlintrc.json`
- `.golangci.yml`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- `.github/dependabot.yml`
- `Makefile` (with install-hooks target)

## Linting Configuration
```yaml
# .golangci.yml
linters-settings:
  gocyclo:
    min-complexity: 15
  goconst:
    min-len: 2
    min-occurrences: 2
  misspell:
    locale: US

linters:
  enable:
    - gofmt
    - goimports
    - govet
    - errcheck
    - staticcheck
    - unused
    - gosimple
    - structcheck
    - varcheck
    - ineffassign
    - deadcode
```

## Coverage Targets
- Unit tests: >80% coverage
- Integration tests: >70% coverage
- Critical paths: >95% coverage
- New code: 100% coverage requirement

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All linting rules pass
- [ ] Test coverage thresholds met
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Documentation is up-to-date
- [ ] Performance benchmarks pass

## Notes
- Consider code complexity metrics
- Plan for technical debt tracking
- Implement automated code review suggestions

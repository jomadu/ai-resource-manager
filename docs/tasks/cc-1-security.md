# CC.1: Security

## Overview
Implement security measures for credential storage, download integrity verification, and safe file extraction. Coordinates with CC.4 for automated security scanning.

## Requirements
- Secure credential storage
- Integrity verification for downloads
- Safe tar.gz extraction
- Path sanitization to prevent directory traversal
- Integration with automated security scanning (gosec)

## Tasks
- [ ] **Secure credential storage**:
  - Use OS keyring/keychain when available
  - Encrypt credentials at rest
  - Avoid storing in plain text config files
  - Support credential rotation
- [ ] **Download integrity verification**:
  - SHA256 checksums for all downloads
  - Verify checksums before extraction
  - Reject corrupted or tampered files
  - Support for signed packages (future)
- [ ] **Safe tar extraction**:
  - Validate all file paths in archive
  - Prevent directory traversal attacks (../)
  - Limit extraction to designated directories
  - Handle symbolic links safely
- [ ] **Path sanitization**:
  - Clean all user-provided paths
  - Validate against allowed directories
  - Prevent access to system files
  - Cross-platform path validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Credentials are stored securely in OS keyring
- [ ] All downloads are verified with checksums
- [ ] Tar extraction prevents directory traversal
- [ ] Path validation blocks malicious paths
- [ ] Security tests cover attack scenarios
- [ ] Clear error messages for security violations

## Dependencies
- github.com/zalando/go-keyring (credential storage)
- crypto/sha256 (standard library)
- path/filepath (standard library)

## Files to Create
- `internal/security/credentials.go`
- `internal/security/integrity.go`
- `internal/security/extraction.go`
- `internal/security/paths.go`

## Security Considerations
- Never log sensitive credentials
- Use secure random for temporary files
- Implement proper cleanup of sensitive data
- Consider sandboxing for extraction operations
- Ensure code passes gosec security scanning (from CC.4)
- Follow secure coding practices to avoid pre-commit hook failures

## Test Cases
- [ ] Directory traversal attempts blocked
- [ ] Invalid checksums rejected
- [ ] Malicious tar files handled safely
- [ ] Credential storage/retrieval works
- [ ] Path validation prevents system access

## Integration Notes
- Security implementation must pass gosec scanning from CC.4
- Security tests should be included in pre-commit hooks
- Coordinate with CC.4 for security vulnerability detection

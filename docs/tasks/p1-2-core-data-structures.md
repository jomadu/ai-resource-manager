# P1.2: Core Data Structures

## Overview
Define the fundamental data structures for rulesets, manifests, and configuration that form the backbone of ARM.

## Requirements
- Ruleset metadata structure
- rules.json schema and parsing
- rules.lock file format
- Registry source configuration types
- Cache directory structure design

## Tasks
- [x] **Define Ruleset struct** - Implemented with validation and checksum support
- [x] **Implement RulesManifest** for rules.json - JSON parsing with schema validation
- [x] **Create RulesLock** structure for rules.lock - Lock file format with checksums
- [x] **Define RegistryConfig** for .armrc - INI parsing with auth token support
- [x] **Design cache directory structure** - Mirrored structure with npm-style URLs
- [x] **Implement semantic versioning** - Full semver parsing and constraint checking

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All structs have proper JSON tags
- [x] Validation methods for each structure
- [x] Parse/serialize methods work correctly
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests for all structures (85.3% coverage)
- [x] Documentation with examples

## Implementation Summary

**Files Created:**
- `pkg/types/ruleset.go` - Ruleset structure with name parsing and validation
- `pkg/types/manifest.go` - RulesManifest and RulesLock with JSON schema validation
- `pkg/types/config.go` - Registry configuration with INI parsing and URL construction
- `pkg/types/cache.go` - Cache management with mirrored directory structure
- `internal/parser/semver.go` - Semantic version parsing and constraint checking

**Test Files:**
- `pkg/types/*_test.go` - Comprehensive unit tests with 85.3% coverage
- `internal/parser/semver_test.go` - Semantic versioning tests with 82.9% coverage

**Key Features:**
- Schema validation from start
- Both scoped (`org@package`) and unscoped (`package`) support
- Full semver range support (`^`, `~`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, exact)
- npm-style registry URLs
- Environment variable substitution for auth tokens
- Mirrored cache structure for simplicity

## Dependencies
- encoding/json (standard library)
- gopkg.in/yaml.v3 (for .armrc INI format alternative)

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

All core data structures implemented with comprehensive validation and testing.

## Notes
- Consider using struct tags for validation
- Plan for schema evolution (version field)
- Ensure thread-safe operations for concurrent access

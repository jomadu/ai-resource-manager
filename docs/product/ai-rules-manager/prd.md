# Product Requirements Document: AI Rules Manager (ARM)

## Introduction/Overview

AI Rules Manager (ARM) is a package manager for AI coding assistant rulesets that enables developers and teams to install, update, and manage coding rules across different AI tools like Cursor and Amazon Q Developer. ARM solves the critical problem of manually copying and managing AI assistant rule files across projects and team members by providing a centralized, version-controlled approach to ruleset distribution and management.

The product eliminates the tedious process of manually copying `.cursorrules` and `.amazonq/rules` files between projects, instead offering a npm-like experience for AI coding rules with support for multiple registry types, semantic versioning, and team synchronization.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate Manual Rule Management**: Replace manual copying/pasting of AI assistant rule files with automated package management
2. **Enable Team Synchronization**: Allow development teams to share and synchronize coding standards through centralized ruleset distribution
3. **Support Version Management**: Provide semantic versioning and dependency resolution for AI coding rulesets
4. **Multi-Registry Support**: Support multiple registry types (Git, S3, GitLab) with extensible architecture
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Deliver fast, reliable performance through Go implementation
6. **Community Adoption**: Drive community adoption and contributions to establish ARM as the standard for AI ruleset management

3.5. The system must generate and maintain lock files (`arm.lock`) for reproducible installations
3.6. The system must warn users about multiple versions of the same ruleset without blocking installation

### 4. Dependency Resolution and Caching
4.1. The system must resolve dependencies using cache-first approach with registry fallback
4.2. The system must cache downloaded rulesets in `~/.arm/cache` with configurable cache location
4.3. The system must handle registry failures gracefully by falling back to cache when available
4.4. The system must not attempt fallback registries when specific source is defined in ruleset specification
4.5. The system must maintain metadata and version information for cached packages

### 5. Command Line Interface
5.1. The system must provide `config` command with subcommands for add, remove, set, and list operations
5.2. The system must provide `install` command supporting both global and local installation with stub file generation
5.3. The system must provide `uninstall` command for removing rulesets from configured channels
5.4. The system must provide `search` command with registry filtering capabilities (globbing patterns and specific registry names)
5.5. The system must provide `info` command for displaying detailed ruleset information
5.6. The system must provide `outdated` command for identifying rulesets with available updates
5.7. The system must provide `update` command for updating installed rulesets to latest compatible versions

7.3. The system must handle network failures gracefully with appropriate fallback mechanisms
7.4. The system must require registry configuration before allowing installations without explicit source
7.5. The system must provide informative messages guiding users to configure generated stub files

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Ruleset Publishing**: ARM will not provide tools for creating or publishing rulesets - it focuses on consumption only
2. **Ruleset Discovery Service**: ARM will not provide a centralized discovery service or registry - users must configure their own registries
3. **AI Tool Integration**: ARM will not integrate directly with AI tools - it manages files that AI tools consume
4. **Existing Configuration Import**: ARM will not auto-detect or import existing AI tool configurations in MVP
5. **Content-based Merging**: ARM will not provide intelligent merging of ruleset contents - conflicts are handled through namespacing
6. **Interactive Conflict Resolution**: ARM will not provide interactive prompts for resolving ruleset conflicts

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- **Language**: Go for cross-platform compatibility and performance
- **Configuration Format**: INI format for `.armrc`, JSON for `arm.json` and `arm.lock`
- **Package Format**: `.tar.gz` archives for most registries, direct file tree access for Git repositories
- **Caching Strategy**: Local filesystem cache with metadata and version tracking

### Registry Integration
- **Git Registries**: Support both Git operations and API-based access (GitHub, GitLab APIs)
- **S3 Registries**: AWS SDK integration with profile and credential support
- **GitLab Registries**: GitLab Package Registry API integration
- **Authentication**: Environment variable and configuration file support for tokens and credentials

### Extensibility
- **Plugin Architecture**: Designed to support additional AI tools through channel configuration
- **Registry Types**: Extensible registry system for future registry type additions
- **Configuration Schema**: Versioned configuration schema for backward compatibility

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
1. **Community Adoption**: Number of active users and installations
2. **Registry Ecosystem**: Number of public registries and available rulesets
3. **Community Contributions**: Number of contributors and community-driven improvements
4. **Integration Usage**: Adoption by AI tool communities and open source projects

### Secondary Metrics

2. **Cache Hit Rate**: Effectiveness of caching in reducing registry requests
3. **Error Rate**: Frequency of configuration and installation errors
4. **Performance**: Installation and update operation completion times

## Open Questions

1. **Registry Standards**: Should ARM define standards for registry metadata and package structure?
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Should future versions include more sophisticated conflict resolution mechanisms?
3. **Security Scanning**: Should ARM include security scanning capabilities for downloaded rulesets?
4. **Telemetry**: What level of usage telemetry should ARM collect to improve the product?
5. **Enterprise Features**: What additional features would enterprise users need (LDAP auth, audit logs, etc.)?

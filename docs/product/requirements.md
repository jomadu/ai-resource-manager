# ARM Product Requirements

*Product requirements and specifications for stakeholders*

## Product Overview

AI Rules Manager (ARM) is a command-line package manager for AI coding assistant rulesets, enabling teams to distribute, version, and manage coding rules across different AI tools like Cursor and Amazon Q Developer.

## Target Users

- **Development Teams** - Standardize coding rules across projects
- **DevOps Engineers** - Manage development environment configurations
- **Individual Developers** - Share and reuse coding rulesets

## Core Features

### Package Management Commands
- **`arm install`** - Install rulesets by name/version or from manifest
- **`arm uninstall`** - Remove installed rulesets
- **`arm list`** - Display installed rulesets (table/JSON formats)
- **`arm update`** - Update rulesets to latest versions
- **`arm outdated`** - Show rulesets with available updates
- **`arm clean`** - Remove unused cache and files

### Configuration Management ✅
- **`.armrc`** - Registry sources and authentication (completed)
- **`rules.json`** - Project ruleset dependencies and targets
- **`rules.lock`** - Locked versions for reproducible installs
- **`arm config`** - Manage configuration settings (completed)

### Supported Targets
- **Cursor IDE** - `.cursorrules` files
- **Amazon Q Developer** - `.amazonq/rules/` directories
- **Extensible** - Architecture supports future AI tools

### Supported Registries
- GitLab package registries
- GitHub package registries
- AWS S3 buckets
- Generic HTTP endpoints
- Local file system

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Installation time < 5 seconds for cached rulesets
- Binary size < 15MB
- Memory usage < 50MB during operations

### Security
- Secure credential storage
- Integrity verification of downloads
- No arbitrary code execution

### Reliability
- Atomic operations (install/uninstall)
- Rollback capability on failures
- Graceful error handling

### Usability
- Clear error messages
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Consistent command interface

## Implementation Decisions

### Language: Go
**Rationale**:
- Zero dependencies for end users
- Fast startup and execution
- Single binary distribution
- Cross-platform compilation
- Strong standard library for HTTP/tar operations

### Architecture: CLI-First
**Rationale**:
- Matches developer workflow expectations
- Easy CI/CD integration
- Scriptable and automatable
- Professional tooling standard

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 (Completed)
- ✅ 3 core commands functional
- ✅ 100% unit test coverage
- ✅ Cross-platform binary builds
- ✅ <2s installation performance

### Phase 2 (In Progress)
- Support for 3+ registry types
- Multi-registry configuration
- Secure authentication handling
- Zero-config setup experience

### Long-term
- 95% command success rate
- Enterprise adoption by development teams
- Integration with major CI/CD platforms

## Non-Goals

- Web-based user interface
- Built-in ruleset authoring tools
- Real-time collaboration features
- Ruleset marketplace/discovery

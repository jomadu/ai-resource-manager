- Add registry metadata fetching capabilities
- Support for GitLab/GitHub package registries

### ðŸŽ¯ Priority 3: P1.6 - Atomic File System Operations
**Branch:** `feat/atomic-file-operations`
**Status:** Enhancement to existing functionality
**Tasks:**
- Implement atomic install/uninstall operations
- Add rollback capability for failed operations
- Handle file permissions across platforms
- Improve error handling and recovery

## Phase 2 Roadmap - Configuration & Registry Support

**Target Completion:** Q1 2025

- **P2.1** Configuration Management (In Progress)
- **P2.2** Registry Abstraction
- **P2.3** Registry Implementations (GitLab, GitHub, S3)
- **P2.4** Version Management (Semantic versioning, ranges)

## Test Registry Usage

The test registry is ready for development and testing:

```bash
# Start test server
cd test/registry && go run server.go

# Test full workflow
go run ./cmd/arm install typescript-rules@1.0.0
go run ./cmd/arm install security-rules@1.2.0
go run ./cmd/arm list --format=json
go run ./cmd/arm uninstall typescript-rules
go run ./cmd/arm list
```

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch from main
2. Use test registry for development/testing
3. Update tasks.md with progress
4. Follow conventional commit messages
5. Ensure pre-commit hooks pass

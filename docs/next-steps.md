- Implement `.armrc` file parsing (INI format)
- Remove hardcoded localhost:8080 registry URL
- Support multiple registry sources
- Add `arm config` command (get, set, list)

## Test Registry Usage

The test registry is ready for development:

```bash
# Start test server
cd test/registry && go run server.go

# Test commands
go run ./cmd/arm install typescript-rules@1.0.0
go run ./cmd/arm list
go run ./cmd/arm uninstall typescript-rules
```

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch from main
2. Use test registry for development/testing
3. Update tasks.md with progress
4. Follow conventional commit messages
5. Ensure pre-commit hooks pass

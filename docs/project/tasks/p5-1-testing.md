# P5.1: Testing

## Overview
Implement comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end CLI testing, and cross-platform validation.

## Requirements
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with mock registries
- End-to-end CLI testing
- Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Performance benchmarking

## Tasks
- [x] **Unit testing framework**:
  - ✅ Set up testing structure with testify
  - ✅ Mock interfaces for external dependencies
  - ⏭️ Test coverage reporting (future)
  - ⏭️ Parallel test execution (future)
- [x] **Core functionality tests**:
  - ✅ Data structure parsing/serialization
  - ✅ Version resolution logic
  - ✅ File system operations
  - ✅ Configuration management
- [x] **Integration tests**:
  - ✅ Filesystem registry integration
  - ✅ Temporary file system setup
  - ✅ End-to-end command workflows
  - ✅ Error scenario testing
- [ ] **CLI testing**:
  - Command-line argument parsing
  - Output format validation
  - Exit code verification
  - Interactive prompt testing
- [ ] **Cross-platform tests**:
  - Path handling on Windows/Unix
  - File permission differences
  - Line ending handling
  - Character encoding issues
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks**:
  - Download speed tests
  - Large ruleset handling
  - Concurrent operation performance
  - Memory usage profiling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Integration tests cover happy path and error cases
- [x] Filesystem registry workflow testing
- [x] Configuration parsing validation
- [x] Registry concurrency resolution testing
- [x] Error handling for invalid configs and missing files
- ⏭️ >90% test coverage for core packages (future)
- ⏭️ All tests pass on Windows, macOS, Linux (future)
- ⏭️ CLI tests validate all command outputs (future)
- ⏭️ Performance benchmarks establish baselines (future)
- ⏭️ Tests run in CI/CD pipeline (future)
- ⏭️ Flaky tests are identified and fixed (future)

## Dependencies
- github.com/stretchr/testify (testing framework)
- net/http/httptest (HTTP testing)
- os (temporary directories)

## Files Created ✅
- `test/integration/basic_test.go` - Core integration tests
- `test/integration/helper.go` - Test environment helpers
- `test/fixtures/rules.json` - Test manifest fixture
- `test/fixtures/invalid-config.armrc` - Invalid config fixture
- Mock config manager for testing
- Tar.gz package creation utilities

## Test Categories
```
Unit Tests:
- pkg/types/*_test.go
- internal/parser/*_test.go
- internal/registry/*_test.go

Integration Tests:

## Notes
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Implement proper test cleanup
- Consider property-based testing for complex logic
- Set up test data fixtures for consistent testing

# P2.4: Version Management

## Overview
Implement semantic version parsing, range resolution, dependency tree resolution, and conflict handling.

## Requirements
- Integrate semantic version parsing library
- Implement version range resolution (^, ~, exact)
- Create dependency tree resolution
- Handle version conflicts

## Tasks
- [x] **Semantic Version Integration**:
  - Use github.com/hashicorp/go-version
  - Parse version strings (1.2.3, v1.2.3-beta.1)
  - Validate version formats
  - Compare versions correctly
- [x] **Version Range Resolution**:
  - Caret ranges: ^1.2.3 (>=1.2.3 <2.0.0)
  - Tilde ranges: ~1.2.3 (>=1.2.3 <1.3.0)
  - Exact versions: 1.2.3
  - Range operators: >=1.0.0 <2.0.0
- [x] **Basic Dependency Resolution**:
  - Version constraint checking implemented
  - Compatible version finding
  - Integration with update/outdated commands
- [ ] **Advanced Dependency Tree** (deferred):
  - Complex transitive dependency resolution
  - Circular dependency detection
  - Advanced conflict resolution strategies

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Version parsing handles all common formats
- [x] Range resolution works for ^, ~, and exact versions
- [x] Version constraint checking works correctly
- [x] Version conflicts show helpful messages
- [x] Resolution algorithm is deterministic
- [ ] Complex dependency trees (deferred to future phase)
- [ ] Circular dependency detection (deferred to future phase)

## Dependencies
- github.com/hashicorp/go-version (semantic versioning)

## Files Created
- `internal/parser/semver.go` ✅ (semantic version parsing)
- `internal/parser/semver_test.go` ✅
- Version constraint logic integrated into updater package ✅
- Registry version resolution implemented ✅

## Example Usage
```go
constraint, _ := version.NewConstraint("^1.2.0")
version, _ := version.NewVersion("1.2.5")
if constraint.Check(version) {
    // Version satisfies constraint
}
```

## Test Cases
- [x] Parse various version formats
- [x] Resolve caret and tilde ranges
- [x] Handle pre-release versions
- [x] Version constraint validation
- [x] Registry version resolution
- [ ] Complex dependency trees (deferred)
- [ ] Circular dependency detection (deferred)

## Implementation Notes
- ✅ Semantic version parsing implemented with comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Version constraint checking integrated into update/outdated commands
- ✅ Registry version resolution working across all registry types
- ✅ Proper handling of pre-release versions and version ranges
- Advanced dependency tree resolution deferred to future phase

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED (Core Features)
**Completion Date**: January 2025
**Note**: Advanced dependency features deferred to future phase
**Commits**:
- Multiple commits implementing version parsing and constraint checking
- Integration with update and outdated commands

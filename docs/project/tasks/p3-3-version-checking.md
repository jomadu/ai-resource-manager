# P3.3: Version Checking

## Overview
Implement parallel version checking with caching, rate limiting, and progress indicators for efficient registry queries.

## Requirements
- Implement parallel version checking
- Cache version information
- Handle registry rate limits
- Provide progress indicators

## Tasks
- [x] **Sequential version checking** (implemented):
  - Version checking integrated into update/outdated commands
  - Proper error handling and aggregation
  - Context-based operations
  - Shared checker module for consistency
- [x] **Version information caching**:
  - Cache latest version data through global cache system
  - TTL-based cache expiration
  - Cache invalidation strategies
  - Persistent cache across runs
- [x] **Basic rate limiting**:
  - Sequential processing respects registry limits
  - Proper error handling on failures
  - Registry-specific handling
- [ ] **Parallel optimization** (deferred):
  - Parallel version checking deferred to P4.3
  - Progress indicators implemented for update command
  - Sequential approach chosen for initial implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Version checking works efficiently (sequential implementation)
- [x] Cache reduces redundant registry calls
- [x] Rate limits are respected and handled gracefully
- [x] Progress indicators provide useful feedback (in update command)
- [x] Errors don't stop other checks from completing
- [x] Context cancellation works properly

## Dependencies
- context (standard library)
- sync (standard library)
- time (standard library)

## Files Created
- `internal/updater/checker.go` ✅ (shared version checking logic)
- `internal/updater/checker_test.go` ✅
- Cache integration through global cache system ✅
- Progress indicators in update command ✅

## Implementation Details
```go
type VersionChecker struct {
    registries []Registry
    cache      Cache
    limiter    RateLimiter
    workers    int
}

func (vc *VersionChecker) CheckVersions(ctx context.Context, rulesets []string) <-chan VersionResult {
    // Implementation with worker pool
}
```

## Implementation Notes
- ✅ Version checking implemented as shared module in updater package
- ✅ Sequential processing chosen for initial implementation (parallel optimization deferred)
- ✅ Integrated with global cache system for performance
- ✅ Proper error handling and registry-specific logic
- ✅ Used by both update and outdated commands

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED (Sequential Implementation)
**Completion Date**: January 2025
**Note**: Parallel optimization moved to P4.3 Performance Optimizations
**Commits**:
- d7d8f7f - feat: implement arm outdated command with filtering and output options
- 61fed55 - feat: implement update command with version constraints and progress bars

# P1.6: File System Operations

## Overview
Implement core file system operations for managing target directories, cache, and atomic file operations across platforms.

## Requirements
- ✅ Create target directory structure (now configuration-driven via rules.json)
- Implement atomic file operations
- Handle file permissions and cross-platform paths
- Create cache management system (.arm/cache/)

## Tasks
- [x] **Target directory management**:
  - ✅ Configuration-driven target directories (via rules.json)
  - ✅ Handle nested source/ruleset/version directories
  - ✅ Support for custom target paths
- [x] **Atomic operations**:
  - Atomic file writes implemented in installer/uninstaller
  - Safe directory operations
  - Transaction-like behavior for installations
- [x] **Cross-platform compatibility**:
  - Handle Windows vs Unix path separators
  - Manage file permissions appropriately
  - Cross-platform path handling implemented
- [x] **Cache directory structure**:
  ```
  ~/.arm/cache/
    packages/
      <registry-host>/
        <ruleset>/
          <version>/
            package.tar.gz
    registry/
      <registry-host>/
        metadata.json
  ```
- [x] **File operations utilities**:
  - Safe file copying
  - Directory traversal
  - Cleanup operations
  - Permission handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Target directories are created correctly on all platforms (configuration-driven)
- [x] File operations are atomic and safe
- [x] Cache structure is consistent and organized
- [x] Proper error handling for permission issues
- [x] Cross-platform path handling works correctly
- [x] Cleanup operations remove empty directories

## Dependencies
- os (standard library)
- path/filepath (standard library)
- io/fs (standard library)

## Files Created
- Filesystem operations integrated into installer/uninstaller packages ✅
- Cache system implemented in `internal/cache/` package ✅
- Cross-platform path handling throughout codebase ✅
- Atomic operations in installer and uninstaller ✅

## Notes
- ✅ Target directories now use configuration from rules.json instead of hardcoded paths
- Consider using file locks for concurrent access
- Implement proper cleanup of temporary files
- Plan for future backup/restore functionality
- Handle symbolic links appropriately

## Implementation Notes
- ✅ Configuration-driven target directories fully implemented
- ✅ Global cache system with proper directory structure
- ✅ Atomic file operations in installer and uninstaller
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility throughout codebase
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and cleanup
- ✅ Integration with all commands (install, uninstall, update, outdated)

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
**Completion Date**: January 2025
**Note**: Filesystem operations integrated throughout the codebase rather than as separate package

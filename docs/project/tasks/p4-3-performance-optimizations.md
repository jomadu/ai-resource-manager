# P4.3: Performance Optimizations

## Overview ✅ COMPLETED
Implement performance optimizations including parallel downloads and progress indicators for improved user experience.

## Requirements ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Implement parallel downloads with per-registry concurrency limits
- ✅ Add download progress indicators
- ⏭️ File system optimizations (deferred to future)
- ⏭️ Incremental updates (deferred to future)

## Tasks ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Parallel downloads**:
  - ✅ Concurrent download workers with semaphore-based limiting
  - ✅ Per-registry concurrency configuration
  - ✅ Registry-specific rate limiting (GitLab: 2, S3: 8, HTTP: 4, Filesystem: 10)
  - ⏭️ Connection pooling for HTTP clients (future enhancement)
  - ⏭️ Bandwidth throttling options (future enhancement)
  - ⏭️ Download resumption support (future enhancement)
- [x] **Progress indicators**:
  - ✅ Real-time download progress bars using progressbar/v3
  - ✅ Simple count-based progress ("Installing 2/5 rulesets...")
  - ⏭️ Transfer speed indicators (future enhancement)
  - ⏭️ ETA calculations (future enhancement)
  - ⏭️ Multi-download progress aggregation (future enhancement)
- [ ] **File system optimizations** (deferred):
  - ⏭️ Batch file operations
  - ⏭️ Memory-mapped file access for large files
  - ⏭️ Efficient directory traversal
  - ⏭️ Atomic multi-file operations
- [ ] **Incremental updates** (deferred):
  - ⏭️ Delta downloads when supported
  - ⏭️ File-level change detection
  - ⏭️ Partial extraction for updates
  - ⏭️ Rollback optimization

## Acceptance Criteria ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Multiple downloads run in parallel efficiently
- [x] Progress bars show accurate information
- [x] Registry-specific concurrency limits respected
- [x] Configuration supports source-specific and type-wide concurrency settings
- [x] Failed downloads continue processing others and report failures
- [x] Comprehensive unit test coverage

## Dependencies
- github.com/schollz/progressbar/v3 (progress bars)
- golang.org/x/sync/semaphore (concurrency control)

## Files Created ✅
- `internal/performance/parallel.go` - Parallel download orchestrator
- `internal/performance/parallel_test.go` - Unit tests
- Updated `internal/config/parser.go` - Performance configuration parsing
- Updated `internal/registry/manager.go` - Concurrency resolution logic
- Updated `cmd/arm/install.go` - Parallel download integration

## Performance Targets
- Download speed: >10MB/s on good connections
- Parallel downloads: 4-8 concurrent by default
- File operations: <100ms for typical rulesets
- Memory usage: <50MB for normal operations

## Implementation Notes
```go
type DownloadManager struct {
    workers    int
    bandwidth  int64  // bytes per second limit
    progress   ProgressReporter
    client     *http.Client
}
```

## Implementation Notes ✅
- Hybrid configuration approach: source-specific overrides + type-wide defaults
- Resolution priority: source.concurrency > performance.{type}.concurrency > performance.defaultConcurrency > hardcoded fallbacks
- Semaphore-based concurrency limiting per registry
- Progress bars supplement existing output without replacement
- Error handling continues processing on failures and reports at end
- ConfigManager interface added for better testability

## Configuration Example
```ini
[sources.company]
type = gitlab
concurrency = 2          # Source-specific override

[sources.company-2]
type = gitlab             # Uses type default

[performance.gitlab]
concurrency = 3           # Type-wide default

[performance]
defaultConcurrency = 5    # Global fallback
```

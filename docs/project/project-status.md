- **`arm list`** - Display installed rulesets (table/JSON formats)

#### Technical Infrastructure
- **Go-based CLI** - Fast, dependency-free binary distribution
- **Configuration-driven targets** - Support for `.cursorrules` and `.amazonq/rules`
- **Test registry** - Local development and testing infrastructure
- **Comprehensive testing** - 100% unit test coverage on core functionality

#### Quality Assurance
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Automated code formatting, linting, security scanning
- **Conventional commits** - Standardized commit messages for automated releases
- **CI/CD pipeline** - Automated testing and quality checks

## Current Development Status

### Active Branch: `docs/update-docs`
- Updating project documentation to reflect current status
- Preparing for Phase 4 completion

### Next Immediate Priority: P4.2 Clean Command
**Target Completion:** February 2025

**Scope:**
- Implement `arm clean` command for cache management
- Storage optimization and cleanup strategies
- User-configurable cache policies

## Technical Metrics

### Code Quality
- **Test Coverage:** 100% on core functionality
- **Go Version:** 1.22
- **Dependencies:** Minimal (Cobra CLI, Viper config, INI parser)
- **Security:** Pre-commit security scanning with gosec

### Performance
- **Install Time:** < 2 seconds for cached rulesets
- **Binary Size:** ~10MB (cross-platform)
- **Memory Usage:** < 50MB during operations

## Completed Phases Summary

### Phase 1: Core Commands ✅ (December 2024)
- `arm install`, `arm uninstall`, `arm list` commands
- Configuration-driven target support
- Comprehensive unit testing

### Phase 2: Configuration & Registry Support ✅ (January 2025)
- Multi-registry configuration system
- GitLab, S3, HTTP, and Filesystem registry support
- Authentication and security handling

### Phase 3: Update/Outdated Functionality ✅ (January 2025)
- `arm update` and `arm outdated` commands
- Version constraint management
- Progress reporting and rollback capabilities

### Phase 4: Cache Management 🚧 (January 2025)
- Global cache system implemented
- Package and metadata caching
- Cache integration across all commands
- Clean command in development

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- **Core functionality** - Proven and tested
- **Architecture** - Solid foundation established
- **Development velocity** - Consistent progress

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- **Registry integrations** - Dependent on external API stability
- **Authentication complexity** - Multiple auth methods to support

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive integration testing with real registries
- Fallback mechanisms for registry unavailability
- Clear error messaging for authentication failures

## Success Metrics (Phases 1-4)

# Technical Documentation

Implementation documentation for ARM developers and AI coding assistants.

## Primary Documents

**[tasks.md](tasks.md)** - Implementation task summary and status
- Phase completion status
- Current priority tasks
- Quick reference to detailed task files

## Detailed Task Files

**[tasks/](tasks/)** - Individual task implementation details
- Each task has dedicated file with context and requirements
- Use for picking up specific development work
- Contains technical specifications and acceptance criteria

## Implementation Guides

**[configuration-driven-targets.md](configuration-driven-targets.md)** - Target directory architecture
**[testing.md](testing.md)** - Test registry and testing procedures
**[testing-uninstall.md](testing-uninstall.md)** - Uninstall command test results

## For AI Assistants

When working on ARM development:
1. **Start with** `tasks.md` for current status and priorities
2. **Reference** `tasks/p{phase}-{number}-{name}.md` for specific task context
3. **Use** implementation guides for technical architecture details
4. **Follow** testing procedures in `testing.md` for validation

### Current Priority
**P2.1 Configuration Management** - See [tasks/p2-1-configuration-management.md](tasks/p2-1-configuration-management.md)

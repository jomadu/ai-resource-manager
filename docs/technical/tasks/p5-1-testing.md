# P5.1: Testing

## Overview
Implement comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end CLI testing, and cross-platform validation.

## Requirements
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with mock registries
- End-to-end CLI testing
- Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Performance benchmarking

## Tasks
- [ ] **Unit testing framework**:
  - Set up testing structure with testify
  - Mock interfaces for external dependencies
  - Test coverage reporting
  - Parallel test execution
- [ ] **Core functionality tests**:
  - Data structure parsing/serialization
  - Version resolution logic
  - File system operations
  - Configuration management
- [ ] **Integration tests**:
  - Mock HTTP registry servers
  - Temporary file system setup
  - End-to-end command workflows
  - Error scenario testing
- [ ] **CLI testing**:
  - Command-line argument parsing
  - Output format validation
  - Exit code verification
  - Interactive prompt testing
- [ ] **Cross-platform tests**:
  - Path handling on Windows/Unix
  - File permission differences
  - Line ending handling
  - Character encoding issues
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks**:
  - Download speed tests
  - Large ruleset handling
  - Concurrent operation performance
  - Memory usage profiling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] >90% test coverage for core packages
- [ ] All tests pass on Windows, macOS, Linux
- [ ] Integration tests cover happy path and error cases
- [ ] CLI tests validate all command outputs
- [ ] Performance benchmarks establish baselines
- [ ] Tests run in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Flaky tests are identified and fixed

## Dependencies
- github.com/stretchr/testify (testing framework)
- net/http/httptest (HTTP testing)
- os (temporary directories)

## Files to Create
- `*_test.go` files for all packages
- `test/integration/` directory
- `test/fixtures/` for test data
- `test/mocks/` for mock implementations
- `benchmark/` for performance tests

## Test Categories
```
Unit Tests:
- pkg/types/*_test.go
- internal/parser/*_test.go
- internal/registry/*_test.go

Integration Tests:
- test/integration/install_test.go
- test/integration/update_test.go
- test/integration/registry_test.go

E2E Tests:
- test/e2e/cli_test.go
- test/e2e/workflows_test.go
```

## Notes
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Implement proper test cleanup
- Consider property-based testing for complex logic
- Set up test data fixtures for consistent testing

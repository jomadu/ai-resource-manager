# P4.3: Performance Optimizations

## Overview
Implement performance optimizations including parallel downloads, progress indicators, file system optimizations, and incremental updates.

## Requirements
- Implement parallel downloads
- Add download progress indicators
- Optimize file system operations
- Implement incremental updates

## Tasks
- [ ] **Parallel downloads**:
  - Concurrent download workers
  - Connection pooling for HTTP clients
  - Bandwidth throttling options
  - Download resumption support
- [ ] **Progress indicators**:
  - Real-time download progress bars
  - Transfer speed indicators
  - ETA calculations
  - Multi-download progress aggregation
- [ ] **File system optimizations**:
  - Batch file operations
  - Memory-mapped file access for large files
  - Efficient directory traversal
  - Atomic multi-file operations
- [ ] **Incremental updates**:
  - Delta downloads when supported
  - File-level change detection
  - Partial extraction for updates
  - Rollback optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multiple downloads run in parallel efficiently
- [ ] Progress bars show accurate information
- [ ] File operations are optimized for speed
- [ ] Large rulesets download quickly
- [ ] Updates only change modified files
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable

## Dependencies
- github.com/schollz/progressbar/v3 (progress bars)
- golang.org/x/sync/semaphore (concurrency control)

## Files to Create
- `internal/performance/downloads.go`
- `internal/performance/progress.go`
- `internal/performance/filesystem.go`
- `internal/performance/incremental.go`

## Performance Targets
- Download speed: >10MB/s on good connections
- Parallel downloads: 4-8 concurrent by default
- File operations: <100ms for typical rulesets
- Memory usage: <50MB for normal operations

## Implementation Notes
```go
type DownloadManager struct {
    workers    int
    bandwidth  int64  // bytes per second limit
    progress   ProgressReporter
    client     *http.Client
}
```

## Notes
- Consider adaptive concurrency based on connection speed
- Plan for bandwidth-limited environments
- Implement proper cleanup of partial downloads
